=== Reactive Streams with Quarkus and Kafka
:experimental:

In this exercise, you will use the Quarkus Kafka extension to build a streaming application using MicroProfile Reactive Streams Messaging and https://kafka.apache.org[Apache Kafka,window=_blank], a distributed streaming platform. You will also use https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi,window=_blank], which provides an easy way to run an Apache Kafka cluster on Kubernetes using https://operatorhub.io/what-is-an-operator[Operators,window=_blank].

=== What is Apache Kafka?

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform. A streaming platform has three key capabilities:

* Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
* Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
* Process streams of records as they occur.

Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:

* Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications
* Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data

=== What is Strimzi?

Strimzi provides a way to run an Apache Kafka cluster on Kubernetes in various deployment configurations.

Strimzi is based on Apache Kafka, and makes it easy to run Apache Kafka on OpenShift or Kubernetes.

Strimzi provides three operators:

* **Cluster Operator** - Responsible for deploying and managing Apache Kafka clusters within an OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.
* **Topic Operator** - Responsible for managing Kafka topics within a Kafka cluster running within an OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.
* **User Operator** - Responsible for managing Kafka users within a Kafka cluster running within an OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.

=== The Goal

In this exercise, we are going to generate (random) names in one component. These names are written in a Kafka topic (`names`). A second component reads from the `names` Kafka topic and applies some magic conversion to the name (adding an honorific). The result is sent to an _in-memory stream_ consumed by a JAX-RS resource. The data is sent to a browser using https://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/[_server-sent events_,window=_blank] and displayed in the browser. It will look like this:
