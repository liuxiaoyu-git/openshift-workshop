### Preparing Quay 

For this lab, we'll use the internal Quay registry. Quay is configured to use Red Hat SSO for authentication.

Open https://{{IMAGE_REGISTRY}} in a browser and login using Red Hat SSO and GitHub IDP.

Then create two new repositories, called _gooperator_ and _ansibleoperator_ and make them public.

Now it's time to crete a Robot Account. Go to _Account settings_ (top right) and click on _Robot accounts_ from the left panel. Create a new account, called _generic_

For each of the repos created before, click on _Settings/_User and Robot Permissions_ from the left panel, select the newly created Robot Account and provide to it write permissions. 

Finally, go again to _Account settings/Robot Accounts_. Click on the wheel from the end of the line corresponding to your account and _View Credentials_

Use this command to login to Quay.

```
docker login -u="radudd+generic" -p="xxxxxx" {{IMAGE_REGISTRY}}
```
