### Creating an account and repositories in Quay

For this lab, we'll need to create two container image repositories for storing the images for the operators we will develop. We will be using the on-prem Quay installation for this.

In order to create the repositories, please follow the steps below.

#### Steps

* Open https://{{IMAGE_REGISTRY}} in a browser and login using Red Hat SSO. Confirm your username in Quay.

* Next, create the repositories. They should be called _go-operator_ and _ansible-operator_. For the purpose of this lab, make the repositories public.

* Then go to _Account settings_ (click on your username top right first) and then click on _Robot_ icon from the left panel. Create a new Robot account, called _generic_

* You will be then prompted to provide permissions for the repositories you created. Select the two repos created earlier and provide the Robot account write permissions to them.

* Still on the Robot screen, click on the wheel from the end of the line corresponding to your account and then on _View Credentials_. You will get the docker command to login to the registry using the robot account.
