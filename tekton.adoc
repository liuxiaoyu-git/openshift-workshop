=== Pipeline Setup

IMPORTANT: We need to import quay image and deploy dc, svc and route if using only rollout. Otherwise we'll need a condition to check if app is not present... and if not use new-app. This needs to be done on both DEV and PROD

IMPORTANT: Update pictures

This tutorial sets up a Tekton pipeline for building and deploying a application. We will use the `people` Quarkus application, i.e. the one that uses Quarkus Kafka extension. 
Since Tekton provides the ability to deploy applications to different clusters, we will use dedicated clusters for Dev and Prod. _OpenShift Pipelines Operator_ needs to be installed only on the Dev cluster.

The pipeline we will build will perform the following steps:

* Run application Unit tests
* Create a native build of the application using S2I
* Push the image to the external container registry (Quay)
* Deploy the application to Dev environment (dedicated Dev cluster)
* (Optional) Run integration tests
* Deploy the application to Prod environment (dedicated Prod cluster)

==== Project Requirements

Since Tekton is still in *Dev Preview*, the Service Accounts it uses require high privileges. 

Switch to your own project. Make sure the resources of the `people` application are deleted.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc project <myuser-namespace>
----

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc delete all -l app=people
----

Then provide the required privileges to `pipeline` and `default` ServiceAccounts. 

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z pipeline && \
oc adm policy add-role-to-user edit -z pipeline && \
oc adm policy add-role-to-user edit -z default && \
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default && \
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default
----

NOTE: The pipeline Service Account is created automatically in all the cluster namespaces after OpenShift Pipelines Operator is installed. It is used by Tekton to interact with OpenShift API.

==== Get authentication token for Prod cluster

Tekton pipelines can be configured with `PipelineResources`, which can be used as inputs or outputs for the tasks in the pipeline. Example of `PipelineResources`: source, image, *cluster*.

A `cluster` resource is basically a definition of another OpenShift cluster and this can be referenced in the Pipeline tasks using KUBECONFIG.

In order to create a `cluster` resource, we will need to generate a secret on the Prod cluster which will contain: 
* The API URL of the Prod cluster
* The Namespace where the application will be deployed on Prod cluster
* The JWT token of the `pipeline` service account from the same Namespace
* Cluster CAFile

This secret will be consumed by the `cluster` PipelineResource.

To generate the secret, connect to Prod cluster and run `gen-secret-pipelineresource-prod-cluster.sh` script. 

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
bash gen-prod-secret.sh <API_URL_PROD_CLUSTER> <NAMESPACE_PROD_CLUSTER>
----

The generated file will be called `pipelineresource-prod-cluster-secret.yaml`

==== Create Tekton resources on Dev cluster

Now it's time to create the Tekton resources required by the pipeline.
After connecting back to Dev cluster, first create `cluster` PipelineResource and the previously generated Secret.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc create -f pipelineresource-prod-cluster-secret.yaml
oc create -f pipelineresource-prod-cluster.yaml
----

After, create the `Tasks` resources. The following will be required for our pipeline:

* openshift-client - for deploying the app on the same cluster
* openshift-client-kubecfg - for deploying the app on a different cluster
* s2i-quarkus-task - for building the app with Quarkus S2I image
* mvn - for running unit tests

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openlab-red/pipelines-catalog/master/quarkus/openshift-client.yaml \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openlab-red/pipelines-catalog/master/quarkus/openshift-client-kubecfg.yaml
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openlab-red/pipelines-catalog/master/quarkus/s2i-quarkus-task.yaml \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openlab-red/pipelines-catalog/master/quarkus/mvn.yaml
----

Check if the tasks were successfully created.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
tkn task ls
----

----
NAME                        AGE
openshift-client            13 seconds ago
openshift-client-kubecfg    13 seconds ago
s2i-quarkus                 13 seconds ago
mvn                         13 seconds ago
----

Next, create the `PipelineResources`. Our pipeline requires two resources:

NOTE: Replace <username> with your assigned user.

* the source git repo hosting the application. 

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineResource
metadata:
  name: gogs
spec:
  type: git
  params:
    - name: url
      value: https://gogs.apps.ocp.bdmsky.net/<username>/quarkus-workshop
EOF
----


* the Docker repository for storing the image artifact

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineResource
metadata:
  name: quay
spec:
  type: image
  params:
    - name: url
      value: "quay.apps.ocp.bdmsky.net/<username>/people:latest"
EOF
----

NOTE: We need to deploy app in prod with image-stream missing tag
NOTE: Need to add integration test

We will use one `Condition` resource in order to check if the app is already deployed in production. Inspect the file and then create the resource.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openlab-red/pipelines-catalog/prod-deployment/quarkus/condition-app-prod-deployed.yaml
----

Check if the resources were created

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get pipelineresource
----

----
NAME   AGE
gogs   12s
quay   10s
----

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get conditions
----

----
NAME           AGE
app-deployed   38s
----


=== Deploy the pipeline

[source,bash]
----
oc create -f pipeline/deploy.yaml
----
Check the pipeline created

[source,bash]
----
oc get pipeline
----

```
NAME             AGE
quarkus-deploy   41s
```

From Developer Console > Pipelines

=== Launch the pipeline

[source,bash]
----
tkn pipeline start quarkus-deploy -p "APP_NAME=people"  -s pipeline
----

Or using Nexus

[source,bash]
----
tkn pipeline start quarkus-deploy -p "MAVEN_MIRROR_URL=http://nexus3.labs:8081/nexus/content/groups/public" -p "APP_NAME=people"  -s pipeline
