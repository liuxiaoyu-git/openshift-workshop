### Requirements

* Git
* operator-sdk 
* docker version 17.03+ or buildah version 1.8.2+
* kubectl or oc (for OpenShift)
* Access to a Kubernetes or an OpenShift cluster
* Quay account

### Configure Code Ready Workspaces

Go to workspace settings:

image::workspaces0.png[]

image::workspaces01.png[]

----
  - mountSources: true
    memoryLimit: 1Gi
    type: dockerimage
    alias: container-tools
    image: 'quay.io/openlab-red/container-tools:latest'
----

*Save and apply the changes*

This will startup the workspace again.

Check your terminal if the tools are installed:

image::workspaces1.png[]

image::workspaces2.png[]

image::workspaces3.png[]

### Scafolding project

```
mkdir projects && cd projects
operator-sdk new hello-operator \
    --api-version=ansible-operator.openshift.pub/v1  \
    --kind=Hello \
    --type=ansible
cd hello-operator
```



### Watches file

The Watches file contains a list of mappings from custom resources, identified
by it's Group, Version, and Kind, to an Ansible Role or Playbook. The Operator
expects this mapping file in a predefined location: `/opt/ansible/watches.yaml`

* **group**:  The group of the Custom Resource that you will be watching.
* **version**:  The version of the Custom Resource that you will be watching.
* **kind**:  The kind of the Custom Resource that you will be watching.
* **role** (default):  This is the path to the role that you have added to the
  container.  For example if your roles directory is at `/opt/ansible/roles/`
  and your role is named `busybox`, this value will be
  `/opt/ansible/roles/busybox`. This field is mutually exclusive with the
  "playbook" field.
* **playbook**:  This is the path to the playbook that you have added to the
  container. This playbook is expected to be simply a way to call roles. This
  field is mutually exclusive with the "role" field.
* **vars**: This is an arbitrary map of key-value pairs. The contents will be
  passed as `extra_vars` to the playbook or role specified for this watch.
* **reconcilePeriod** (optional): The reconciliation interval, how often the
  role/playbook is run, for a given CR.
* **manageStatus** (optional): When true (default), the operator will manage
  the status of the CR generically. Set to false, the status of the CR is
  managed elsewhere, by the specified role/playbook or in a separate controller.

An example Watches file:

```
---
# Simple example mapping Foo to the Foo role
- version: v1alpha1
  group: foo.example.com
  kind: Foo
  role: /opt/ansible/roles/Foo

# Simple example mapping Bar to a playbook
- version: v1alpha1
  group: bar.example.com
  kind: Bar
  playbook: /opt/ansible/playbook.yml

# More complex example for our Baz kind
# Here we will disable requeuing and be managing the CR status in the playbook,
# and specify additional variables.
- version: v1alpha1
  group: baz.example.com
  kind: Baz
  playbook: /opt/ansible/baz.yml
  reconcilePeriod: 0
  manageStatus: false
  vars:
    foo: bar
```

### Customize the operator logic

For this example the ansible-operator will execute the following
reconciliation logic for each `Hello` Custom Resource (CR):

* Create a hello Deployment if it doesn't exist
* Ensure that the Deployment size is the same as specified by the `Hello` CR

### Watch the Hello CR

By default, the hello-operator watches `Hello` resource events as shown in `watches.yaml` and executes Ansible Role `Hello`:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cat watches.yaml
----

----
- version: v1
  group: ansible-operator.openshift.pub
  kind: Hello
  role: /opt/ansible/roles/hello
----

### Define the Hello spec

Defining the spec for an Ansible Operator can be done entirely in Ansible. The
Ansible Operator will simply pass all key value pairs listed in the Custom
Resource spec field along to Ansible as extra
variables.
The names of all variables in the spec field are converted to snake_case
by the operator before running ansible. For example, `serviceAccount` in
the spec becomes `service_account` in ansible.
It is recommended that you perform some type validation in Ansible on the
variables to ensure that your application is receiving expected input.

First, set a default in case the user doesn't set the `spec` field by modifying
`roles/hello/defaults/main.yml`:

```
size: 1
```

### Defining the Hello deployment

Now that we have the spec defined, we can define what Ansible is actually
executed on resource changes. Since this is an Ansible Role, the default
behavior will be to execute the tasks in `roles/hello/tasks/main.yml`. We
want Ansible to create a deployment if it does not exist which runs the
`openshift/hello-openshift` image.

Modify `roles/hello/tasks/main.yml` to look like the following:

[source,yaml,role="copypaste"]
----
- name: hello
  k8s:
    definition:
      kind: Deployment
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      metadata:
        name: '{ { meta.name } }-hello'
        namespace: '{ { meta.namespace } }'
      spec:
        replicas: { {size} }
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            app: hello
        template:
          metadata:
            labels:
              app: hello
          spec:
            containers:
            - name: hello
              image: "openshift/hello-openshift"
----

It is important to note that we used the `size` variable to control how many
replicas of the Hello deployment we want. We set the default to `1`, but
any user can create a Custom Resource that overwrites the default.

### Build and run the operator

First go to your own project.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc project <myuser-namespace>
----

Before running the operator, Kubernetes needs to know about the new custom
resource definition the operator will be watching.

### Run the operator

NOTE: Replace <user> with your own user

Build the hello-operator image and push it to a registry:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
operator-sdk build {{IMAGE_REGISTRY}}/<user>/ansible-operator:latest
----

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
docker push {{IMAGE_REGISTRY}}/<user>/ansible-operator:latest
----

Kubernetes deployment manifests are generated in `deploy/operator.yaml`. The
deployment image in this file needs to be modified from the placeholder
`REPLACE_IMAGE` to the previous built image. To do this run:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
$ sed -i 's|{ { REPLACE_IMAGE } }|{{IMAGE_REGISTRY}}/<user>/ansible-operator:latest|g' deploy/operator.yaml
----

The `imagePullPolicy` also requires an update.  To do this run:
[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
sed -i 's|{ { pull_policy\|default('\''Always'\'') } }|Always|g' deploy/operator.yaml
----

Deploy the hello-operator:
[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc create -f deploy
----

Verify that the hello-operator is up and running:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get deployment
----

### Create a Hello CR

Modify `deploy/crds/ansible-operator.openshift.pub_v1_hello_cr.yaml` as shown and create a `Hello` custom resource:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cat deploy/crds/ansible-operator.openshift.pub_v1_hello_cr.yaml
----

----
apiVersion: "cache.example.com/v1alpha1"
apiVersion: ansible-operator.openshift.pub/v1
kind: Hello
metadata:
  name: example-hello
spec:
  # Add fields here
  size: 3
----

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc apply -f deploy/crds/ansible-operator.openshift.pub_v1_hello_cr.yaml
----

Ensure that the operator creates the deployment for the CR:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get deployment
----

### View the Ansible logs

The `hello-operator` deployment creates a Pod with two containers, `operator` and `ansible`.
The `ansible` container exists only to expose the standard Ansible stdout logs that most Ansible
users will be familiar with. In order to see the logs from a particular container, you can run

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc logs deployment/hello-operator -c ansible
oc logs deployment/hello-operator -c operator
----

The `ansible` logs contain all of the information about the Ansible run and will make it much easier to debug issues within your Ansible tasks,
whereas the `operator` logs will contain much more detailed information about the Ansible Operator's internals and interface with Kubernetes.

### Additional Ansible debug

Occasionally while developing additional debug in the Operator logs is nice to have. To enable Ansible debug output, ie `-vvvv`.
Add the following to the `operator.yaml` manifest.

```
          env:
           ...
           - name: ANSIBLE_VERBOSITY
             value: "4"
```

### Update the size

Change the `spec.size` field in the memcached CR from 3 to 4 and apply the
change:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc patch hello example-hello --type merge --patch \'\{"spec": \{"size": 2 \}\}'
----

Confirm that the operator changes the deployment size:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc get deployment
----

### Cleanup

Clean up the resources:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc delete -f deploy/crds/*cr.yaml
oc delete -f deploy/crds/*crd.yaml
oc delete -f deploy
----
