### Create your first Go operator

#### Requirements

* Git
* Go version 1.12.x
* operator-sdk version v0.8.x
* docker version 17.03+ or buildah version 1.8.2+
* kubectl or oc (for OpenShift)
* Access to a Kubernetes or an OpenShift cluster
* Quay account

#### Skaffolding project

Note: You can chose between using dep or modules. Modules are used by default. In next versions it will also be added support by default for external vendoring (i.e. `--vendor=false`).

```
mkdir projects && cd projects
operator-sdk new hellogo-operator --repo --repo=github.com/radudd/hellogo-operator
cd hellogo-operator
```

After that review the generated code and resources. Pay special attention to the following:

* deploy folder containing yaml files to easily run your operator on kubernetes
* cmd/manager The manager register the scheme for all custom resources under `pkg/apis` and run all controlers under `pkg/controller`
* pkg/controller The controllers implementation
* pkg/apis The custom types definitions

Check the [project scaffolding layout](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/project_layout.md) for more details

#### Let's add a new CRD

```
cd hellogo-operator
operator-sdk add api --api-version=hellogo.workshop.redhat.com/v1alpha1 --kind=HelloGo
```

After that we can see the following changed:

* deploy/crds is created with a basic CRD (including OpenApiV3Schema validation) and a sample CR
* pkg/apis now has a folder containing a file `<my_kind>_types.go` with the CRD struct

#### Create the controller for our CRD

```
operator-sdk add controller --api-version=hellogo.workshop.redhat.com/v1alpha1 --kind=HelloGo
```

Let's review:

* `pkg/controller/<my_kind>/<my_kind>_controller.go` has a default implementation that creates a `busybox` pod

#### Define the CRD

Go to the `pkg/apis/<my_kind>/<my_kind>_types.go` file and define your custom resource.

```
type HelloGoSpec struct {
	// INSERT ADDITIONAL SPEC FIELDS - desired state of cluster
	// Important: Run "operator-sdk generate k8s" to regenerate code after modifying this file
	// Add custom validation using kubebuilder tags: https://book-v1.book.kubebuilder.io/beyond_basics/generating_crd.html

	Size int32 `json:"size"`
}
```

When finished, run the following to update the generated code:

```
operator-sdk generate k8s
```

Note: Run this command each time you change the types

### Generate the OpenAPI validation

```
operator-sdk generate openapi
```

Verify that your custom resource definition has a generated.

Note: Run this command only when you want to replace the CRD with the new generated values. **This will overwrite any customization**

#### Implement the controller

1. Watch for changes in owned objects: Just add here the ones you feel necessary.
1. Implement the reconcile loop: You will receive notification changes for all the watched objects (CustomResources and OwnedObjects). Create the owned objects that are missing or replace them if the expected objects don't match with the existing ones.
1. Update the `role.yaml` in case different permissions are required (e.g. create `ingress` or `route`)

#### Run the Operator locally

```
oc project go-operator-tutorial
oc create -f deploy/crds/hellogo_v1alpha1_hellogo_crd.yaml
go mod vendor
operator-sdk up local --namespace=go-operator-tutorial
```

Now you can create an example CR. Notice that the generated CR is not valid.

### Build the Operator


```
operator-sdk build --image-builder docker {{IMAGE_REGISTRY}}/{username}/gooperators/hellogo-operator:latest
...
INFO[0008] Operator build complete.
```

Push the image to your quay.io repository (make sure the repository is public for this workshop)

```
docker push {{IMAGE_REGISTRY}}/{username}/gooperators/hellogo-operator:latest
```

### Deploy the Operator in your Kubernetes cluster

Before deploying the Operator make sure you replaced all the placeholders:

```
sed -i 's|REPLACE_IMAGE|{{IMAGE_REGISTRY}}/{username}/gooperators/hellogo-operator:latest|g' deploy/operator.yaml
```

Create the CRD (if you haven't done it yet)

```
oc create -f deploy/crds/hellogo_v1alpha1_hellogo_crd.yaml
operator-sdk up local --namespace=default
```

Create all the necessary resources

```
$ oc create -f deploy
deployment.apps/hellogo-operator created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/hellogo-operator created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/hellogo-operator created
serviceaccount/hellogo-operator created
```

Deploy the CR and check if the hello pod is created by the operator

```
oc create -f deploy/crds/hellogo.workshop.redhat.com_v1alpha1_hellogo_cr.yaml                                       
oc get pods
```

#### Cleanup
```
oc delete -f deploy
oc delete -f deploy/cr
```
